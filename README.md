Hi, I am a Data Science and Analytics professional currently pursuing Master’s in Data Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, with a strong foundation in mathematics and advanced skills in machine learning, data analysis and visualization. My academic journey, combined with practical experience, has equipped me with expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, statistical analysis, and data visualization, enabling me to turn complex datasets into actionable insights.

I have hands-on experience developing algorithms, data-driven solutions, and machine learning models that optimize processes and inform decision-making across diverse domains. Through various projects, I have built recommendation systems, crafted real-time dashboards, and applied predictive modeling techniques to enhance user engagement and increase efficiency.

With technical proficiency in Python, R, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, alongside experience with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, HuggingFace and Scikit-learn, I am passionate about solving business challenges and driving impactful outcomes. My goal is to continue leveraging data science skills to support innovative solutions and contribute to organizational growth.
